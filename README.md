# mantel

**A universal, MCP-native desktop chat client — local-first, any backend.**

Mantel is a clickable chat app that talks to **any** model backend and defaults
to a **local [hearth](https://github.com/yumima/hearth) engine** on loopback. It
(will) host **MCP servers** so the model can use *your* tools — files, search,
databases, your own services — with **you** deciding which tools, regardless of
which model you run. Your data and tools stay local unless you explicitly opt
into a cloud backend or a remote server.

> **Status: M2** — a working desktop chat client that **hosts MCP servers**: the
> model can use *your* tools (deny-by-default), across any OpenAI-compatible
> backend, with a hearth-style management CLI. Multi-vendor adapters, profiles,
> and interactive approval are on the roadmap below.

## Why (vs. ChatGPT / Claude desktop)
- **No vendor lock-in.** One UI, any model — a free local model for most work, a
  frontier cloud model when you need it. The big clients are single-vendor.
- **Your tools, via MCP.** The tools the model can use are *yours* to configure —
  not a vendor's curated connector list — and work with whatever model you pick.
- **Local-first & private.** Defaults are local, no keys, no egress; cloud and
  remote MCP servers are explicit, labeled opt-ins.
- **Profiles** *(roadmap)* — one click swaps the whole stack: backend + model +
  MCP servers + system prompt.

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yumima/mantel && cd mantel
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[gui]"   # [gui] = native window (pywebview)

# with a hearth engine running on :11435 (see github.com/yumima/hearth):
.venv/bin/mantel            # opens the desktop chat window
# or:
.venv/bin/mantel serve      # headless — open http://127.0.0.1:8765 in a browser
.venv/bin/mantel install    # add a clickable launcher to your app menu
```
Without `[gui]`/pywebview, `mantel` falls back to a Chromium/Edge `--app` window,
then your default browser.

## Commands
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mantel` | open the desktop chat window (starts mantel's local server) |
| `mantel setup` | first-run wizard — find a backend, pick a model, seed MCP examples |
| `mantel status` | backend reachability, model, MCP servers + tool counts |
| `mantel doctor` | diagnose the environment (backend, MCP runtimes, window) |
| `mantel models` | list models from the active backend |
| `mantel config [show\|path\|edit]` | show / locate / edit the config file |
| `mantel mcp list\|tools\|enable <n>\|disable <n>` | manage MCP servers |
| `mantel provider list\|use <n>` | manage backends |
| `mantel serve` | run the local server in the foreground (headless / dev) |
| `mantel install` / `uninstall` | add / remove the clickable desktop launcher |

## Architecture
Mantel runs a tiny **local server** (FastAPI) that serves the chat UI and proxies
chat/models to the configured backend under `/api/*`. The UI is **same-origin**
with mantel, so streaming `fetch` works with no CORS; mantel talks to the backend
**server-to-server** (so a loopback-only engine like hearth, with no CORS, works
fine). That proxy is exactly where the **MCP host + tool-call loop** land (M2).

```
window (pywebview)  →  mantel server (FastAPI)  →  backend (hearth / OpenAI / …)
   UI at  /               /api/chat  /api/models      /v1/chat/completions
                          + MCP host + agent loop ───→ MCP servers (your tools)
```

## Tools (MCP)
Mantel is an **MCP host**: the enabled servers' tools are offered to the model,
and mantel runs the **tool-calling loop** for you — executing calls, feeding
results back, looping until the model answers. Tool activity streams live into
the chat.

Execution is **deny-by-default**: a tool runs only if its name matches one of
its server's `auto_approve` globs — anything else is refused, so an autonomous
model can't touch files / shells / networks you didn't allow.

```bash
mantel setup                  # seeds safe, *disabled* example servers (needs npx)
mantel mcp list               # see configured servers
mantel mcp enable filesystem  # turn one on
mantel mcp tools              # what tools are now available
mantel                        # (re)open the window to pick up the change
```

Add your own with `mantel config edit`:
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  filesystem:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "~/projects"]
    enabled: true
    auto_approve: ["read_*", "list_*"]   # reads auto-run; writes are refused
```
Any standard MCP **stdio** server works — `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-*`,
`uvx mcp-server-*`, or one of your own.

**Manage it from the chat window** — no terminal needed. Type `/help`:
`/tools`, `/servers`, `/enable <name>` / `/disable <name>` (applied **live** —
no restart), `/provider <name>`, `/model <name>`, `/status`, `/clear`.

## Config
`~/.config/mantel/config.yaml` (optional — absent ⇒ local hearth defaults):
```yaml
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 8765
provider: hearth
model: primary_chat
providers:
  hearth: { type: openai, base_url: http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1 }
```

## Security
mantel binds **loopback only** and runs a **localhost guard** — a Host-header
allowlist plus cross-origin refusal — so a malicious web page in your browser
can't reach the server (DNS-rebinding / CSRF). That matters because the server
executes MCP tools and mutates config. Tool execution is **deny-by-default**;
note that `auto_approve` matches the **tool name the server reports**, so prefer
specific names over broad globs and use `*` only for servers you fully trust.
The config file (which may hold provider API keys) is written `0600`.

## Roadmap
- **M0 — scaffold + chat-to-hearth** ✅
- **M2 — MCP host + agent loop** ✅ — stdio servers, tool aggregation, the tool-calling loop, deny-by-default execution, live tool activity, a hearth-style management CLI (`setup` / `status` / `doctor` / `mcp` / `provider` / …).
- **M1 — multi-vendor backends** — Anthropic / Gemini adapters + key storage (any *OpenAI-compatible* backend already works via config).
- **M3 — profiles + settings UI** — profile switcher (backend + model + servers + prompt), server catalog, **interactive** tool approval.
- **M4 — connectors + packs** — credentialed servers (search / github / …), remote (SSE/HTTP) servers, domain packs.
- **M5 — distribution** — standalone bundles + GitHub releases.

## Develop
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
